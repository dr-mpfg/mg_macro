<br />

I am an economist and political economist, currently covering the position of Lecturer in Economics in the Department of Economics at SOAS University of London. I am also an Associate Researcher at the Global Climate Forum in Berlin, where I contribute to the project on the [OBFA-TRANSFORM Project](https://obfa-transform.eu).

My main areas of interest are European Political Economy, Financialisation, Financial and Monetary Macroeconomics, International Economics, and History of Economic Thought. I am most fascinated by monetary system, especially monetary unions, of which I tend to focus on the Eurozone and the CFA Franc.

My current projects are my research on Monetary and Financial Subordination in the EMU, a modelling of financial Macro-Structures and Debt Management, and the assessment of the Global Financial Crisis and the Eurozone Crisis through changing financial architectures. I primarily work with time series and panel data.

I am happy to consult or discuss any projects on pertinent topics.

I am a member of the European Research Network on Economic and Social Policy (EReNSEP) and of the Young Scholars Initiative (YSI, of INET).
