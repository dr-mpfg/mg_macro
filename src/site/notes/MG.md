<br />


I am an economist and political economist, currently working for the [UKDSC](https://www.ukdsc.org) as a defence economist.
I am also an Associate Researcher at the Global Climate Forum in Berlin, where I contribute to the project on the [OBFA-TRANSFORM Project](https://obfa-transform.eu) and to the building of the [Monetary Architecture Online Tool](https://monetary-architecture.com/).
Previously, I was a Lecturer in Economics in the Department of Economics at SOAS University of London between.

My main areas of interest span from War Economics to Financial and Monetary Macroeconomics, including European Political Economy, Financialisation, International Economics, and History of Economic Thought. I am most fascinated by monetary system and financial architectures.
I am especially keen on working on monetary unions, of which I tend to focus on the Eurozone and the CFA Franc.

Outside of my professional -restricted- work, my current projects are my research on Monetary and Financial Subordination in the EMU, a modelling of financial Macro-Structures and Debt Management, and the assessment of the Global Financial Crisis and the Eurozone Crisis through changing financial architectures. I primarily work with time series and panel data.

I welcome collaboration, discussion, and professional connections. You can [contact me](mailto:mg.macroeconomics@gmail.com), [download my CV](https://app.box.com/s/22zc5n2grmm6u1jvyzyshn42j699dcqw), or explore my research projects and publications through the links above.

I am a member of the European Research Network on Economic and Social Policy (EReNSEP) and of the Young Scholars Initiative (YSI, of INET).
